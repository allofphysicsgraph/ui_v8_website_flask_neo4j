      retries: 20       # It takes retries consecutive failures of the health check for the container to be considered unhealthy.
      start_period: 10s # provides initialization time for containers that need time to bootstrap. Probe failure during that period will not be counted towards the maximum number of retries. However, if a health check succeeds during the start period, the container is considered started and all consecutive failures will be counted towards the maximum number of retries.
