In the v7 JSON implementation, the only way to create a new expression was to have the expression be associated with a specific derivation in a (new) step. The intent of this was to ensure there were no unconnected expressions. As a positive side-effect, associating a new expression with a derivation helped with guessing the symbols.

In the new 2024 design, expressions can not be created during the specification of a derivation step. 
Now an expression has to be created prior to being referenced in a step. The value of separating these actions is that the interaction with the user is easier when processing one expression (rather than a bunch concurrently all related to the step).
Two consequences from this approach:
- guessing the symbols lacks context of a derivation
- expressions may be unconnected to a derivation step

Interestingly, in the v7 JSON implementation a user could add new symbols that were not referenced by any expression.
